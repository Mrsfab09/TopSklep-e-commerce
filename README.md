I present a project created in React - my efforts during an intensive programming course. 
Thanks to the 'ZrozumieÄ‡ React' course, I learned the secrets of creating interactive user interfaces, 
which have now turned into a functional project.

Designing this application was an amazing experience for me - every component, every lifecycle, every external API 
connection was part of my learning and development of programming skills. From simple components to more advanced aspects, 
this project was a testing ground for my knowledge and creativity in the world of React.
